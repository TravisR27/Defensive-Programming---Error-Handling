# Defensive-Programming---Error-Handling

Practical Task 1
For both the errors.py and errors2.py task files in your folder, open the files and
follow these steps:
● Attempt to run the program. You will encounter various errors.
● Fix the errors and then run the program.
● Each time you fix an error, add a # comment in the line where you fixed it
and indicate which of the three types of errors it was with a brief
explanation of why that is.
● Save the corrected file.

Practical Task 2
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file called logic.py.
● Write a program that displays a logical error (be as creative as possible!).
